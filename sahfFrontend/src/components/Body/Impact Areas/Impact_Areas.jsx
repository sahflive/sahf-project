                  Physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access,
                  defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within
                  5 km from the place of residence or work” Using this
                  definition, a study in India in 2012 found that in rural
                  areas, only 37% of people were able to access IP facilities
                  within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access
                  out-patient facilities Krishna and Ananthapur, in their 2012
                  paper, postulate that in general, the more rustic (rural)
                  one's existence – the further one lives from towns – the
                  greater are the odds of disease, malnourishment, weakness, and
                  premature death.

                  We must encourage discussion on the determinants of access to
                  healthcare. We should identify and analyze possible barriers

                  system-related domains, and do our best to get our students

                  healthcare.
